# THE FALLING SPEED OF PETALS - 8kyu

The solution to this problem is written in JavaScript the detail about the problem is below and you can check the solution above.

## 💬 Description 💬

Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground from the same branch.

## 🥚 Input 🥚

```
 10 (Integer)
```

## 🐣 Output 🐣

```
 40 (Integer)
```

## 👓 Explanation 👓

```
 1# Find the distance with the formula [s = v * t]
 s = distance [cm]
 v = average velocity [cm/s]
 t = time [s]
 2# s = 5[cm/s] * 80[s] = 400cm
 3# Divide 's' with the input
 3# 400 / 10;
 3# 40 🎉
